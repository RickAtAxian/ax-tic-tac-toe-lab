# WorkTracker.md

## Overview

This file is the planning tracker for the Tic Tac Toe lab effort. It is intended to mimic a lightweight work-tracking backend such as Jira or Azure DevOps using markdown.

- Tracking timestamp: `2026-03-30 15:36 UTC`
- Planning status: `Execution complete through Phase 3; Phase 4 items remain backlog only`
- Planning owner: `Codex`
- Review owner: `User`
- Execution rule: complete work one phase at a time and stop after each meaningful milestone for user testing and explicit acceptance before continuing.

## Status Legend

- `Proposed`: planned but not yet approved for execution.
- `Ready`: approved and next in queue.
- `In Progress`: actively being implemented.
- `Blocked`: cannot continue until dependency or decision is resolved.
- `In Review`: ready for user review/testing.
- `Accepted`: reviewed and accepted by the user.
- `Done`: fully completed and closed.
