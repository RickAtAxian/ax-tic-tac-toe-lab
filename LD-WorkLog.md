# LD-WorkLog.md

## 2026-03-30 15:36 UTC

- Created `WorkTracker.md` to serve as the markdown work-tracking board for this repository.
- Organized the project into three epics mapped to Phases 1, 2, and 3.
- Planned stories under each epic with title, description, date/time, status, assignment, and comments fields.
- Added review and acceptance gates to the plan so execution can pause after meaningful milestones.

## 2026-03-31 12:47 UTC

- Established the first milestone as an initial git checkpoint.
- Added `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules/` from version control.
- Prepared the repository state for the first commit named `Initial Setup`.

## 2026-03-31 12:52 UTC

- Started Story `1.1` for the Phase 1 scaffold milestone.
- Chose `Vite + React + TypeScript` as the frontend foundation for fast local boot, simple bundling, and a clean TypeScript setup.
- Added app scripts in `package.json`: `dev`, `build`, `preview`, and `typecheck`.
- Added scaffold/config files: `index.html`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, and the initial `src/` tree.
- Created the initial source layout under `src/app`, `src/pages`, `src/features/game`, and `src/styles`.
- Built a placeholder app shell and static board preview to confirm the app boots without moving ahead into gameplay implementation.
- Expanded `.gitignore` to exclude `dist/`.
- Re-ran dependency installation serially after an initial parallel install pass so `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `node_modules` stayed aligned.
- Verified the milestone with `npm run build`.
- Verified the dev boot path by starting `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173` and confirming an HTTP `200` response from `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Epic `EPIC-01` to `In Progress` and Story `STORY-1.1` to `In Review`.

## 2026-03-31 13:08 UTC

- Removed the unused `codex` dependency from `package.json`.
- Ran `npm uninstall codex` to synchronize `package-lock.json` and the local dependency tree.
- Re-checked dependency health after the removal and confirmed `npm audit` reports `0 vulnerabilities`.

## 2026-03-31 13:09 UTC

- Story `1.1` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `1.1` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Recorded that `codex` had been added to the app dependency tree unnecessarily during setup work and was removed once reviewed.
- Preserved the scaffold milestone boundary so future work can start at Story `1.2`.

## 2026-03-31 13:13 UTC

- Started Story `1.2` for the Phase 1 game-domain milestone.
- Added a UI-independent game model under `src/features/game/model/`.
- Implemented pure game-state creation, move application, turn tracking, legal-move validation, winner detection, draw detection, available-move derivation, and move history tracking.
- Implemented deterministic CPU move selection with a stable priority order and immediate win/block checks.
- Updated the existing board preview component to render board state supplied by the game domain rather than hard-coded values.
- Added a read-only domain preview on the scaffold page to show a sample board state and CPU recommendation without moving into Story `1.3` gameplay flow work.
- Corrected the scaffold page copy so it reflects the Story `1.2` milestone rather than the earlier scaffold milestone.
- Verified the milestone with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-1.2` to `In Review`.

## 2026-03-31 13:16 UTC

- Story `1.2` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `1.2` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Started Story `1.3` for the Phase 1 single-player gameplay-flow milestone.
- Scoped this milestone to landing page, start-game flow, playable game screen, quit action, CPU rematch loop, and game status messaging only.

## 2026-03-31 13:18 UTC

- Replaced the scaffold-only app shell with a two-screen Phase 1 flow: landing page and single-player game page.
- Added a `Play vs. CPU` entry point on the landing page.
- Wired the app to create a fresh game, enter the game screen, and render live status text from the game domain.
- Added CPU turn handling in the app layer using the deterministic move selector from the game model.
- Added playable board input, in-game status pills, game detail summary, quit action, and rematch action.
- Kept the implementation inside Story `1.3` boundaries and deferred richer feedback concerns such as celebration, sound, and advanced move affordances to Story `1.4`.
- Verified the UI milestone with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`.
- Ran a game-domain smoke test by compiling the game model to `/tmp` and confirming a deterministic CPU response sequence after player moves.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-1.3` to `In Review`.

## 2026-03-31 13:25 UTC

- Story `1.3` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `1.3` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Started Story `1.4` for the Phase 1 feedback-and-celebration milestone.
- Scoped this milestone to move affordances, illegal-move feedback, and lightweight win/loss celebration behavior only.

- Added hover-aware board feedback so the UI distinguishes currently available and unavailable moves.
- Adjusted board interaction so blocked moves still surface feedback instead of failing silently.
- Added in-game feedback messaging for occupied cells, unavailable moves, and finished-game clicks.
- Added lightweight generated audio cues for moves, wins, losses, and draws using the browser audio API.
- Added visual outcome treatment for win, loss, and draw states through banners, board highlighting, and panel emphasis.
- Verified the milestone with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-1.4` to `In Review`.

## 2026-03-31 13:30 UTC

- Story `1.4` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `1.4` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Started Story `1.5` for the Phase 1 automated-test milestone.
- Scoped this milestone to unit coverage for the game domain and a terminal-runnable Playwright winning-flow test.

- Added `vitest` and `@playwright/test` as dev dependencies.
- Added terminal scripts for unit tests, e2e tests, and the combined test run.
- Added a dedicated `vitest.config.ts` so unit runs only pick up `tests/unit/**`.
- Added unit coverage for game state creation, move legality, winner detection, draw detection, and deterministic CPU behavior.
- Added Playwright configuration that starts the Vite app automatically for browser tests.
- Added an end-to-end Playwright scenario that completes a deterministic player win against the CPU.
- Corrected one unit-test setup bug where the expected CPU winning move was asserted on the wrong turn.
- Corrected the Playwright winning path after brute-forcing a real player-win sequence against the current deterministic CPU logic.
- Installed Playwright Chromium browser binaries and then installed the missing system libraries with `npx playwright install-deps chromium` so browser tests could run in this container.
- Verified the milestone with `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:e2e`, and `npm test`.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-1.5` to `In Review`.

## 2026-03-31 13:38 UTC

- Story `1.5` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `1.5` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Started and completed Story `1.6` for the Phase 1 documentation and deployment-baseline milestone.
- Replaced the starter `README.md` with a project-specific guide covering setup, scripts, testing, architecture, and deployment baseline usage.
- Added `docs/architecture.md` to document the Phase 1 client-only design and runtime flow.
- Added `docs/project-organization.md` to describe the repo structure and ownership of major directories.
- Added `infra/cloudformation/static-site.yml` as a low-cost AWS static-site baseline using S3 website hosting.
- Added `infra/deploy-static-site.sh` to build the app, deploy the CloudFormation stack, and sync the built site to S3.
- Added `infra/README.md` to explain required AWS inputs and the deployment flow.
- Added `npm run deploy:static` and extended `.gitignore` to cover Playwright output artifacts.
- Removed the unnecessary IAM capability flag from the deployment script because the template does not create IAM resources.
- Verified the milestone with `bash -n infra/deploy-static-site.sh` and `npm run build`.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-1.6` to `In Review`.

## 2026-03-31 13:44 UTC

- Added a new Phase 1 backlog item, Story `1.7`, to cover configurable status-bar modes.
- Wrote the story with four explicit supported values:
  `1 = AsBuilt`, `2 = AlwaysOn`, `3 = Bottom`, `4 = BottomAlwaysOn`.
- Recorded that the current target/default setting for future implementation should be mode `2`.
- Wrote the story text to emphasize a configurable UI state rather than a one-off hard-coded layout tweak.

## 2026-03-31 13:46 UTC

- Expanded Story `1.7` to add a fifth status-bar mode: `5 = InGameDetailCard`.
- Corrected the implementation target so the mode system applies to the larger dynamic game-status panel rather than the compact pill strip.
- Restored the compact summary strip to the hero card.
- Implemented a configurable game-status panel component and mode configuration in the app.
- Changed the active/default status-bar mode from `2` to `5`.
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/project-organization.md` so all five supported values and the current default are documented.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-1.7` to `In Review`.

## 2026-03-31 13:49 UTC

- This status-bar interaction went badly.
- I misidentified the UI element the user wanted changed and implemented a much broader system than requested.
- That created unnecessary code churn, documentation churn, and avoidable back-and-forth.
- The correct target was the larger changing status area at the top of the game screen, not the compact pill-style summary row.
- The better approach would have been to verify the exact target in the existing UI and make the smallest possible change first.

## 2026-03-31 14:05 UTC

- Reverted the mis-scoped status-mode implementation from the app, styles, and documentation.
- Removed the temporary `GameStatusBar`, `GameStatusPanel`, and `statusBar` configuration files because they were part of the unnecessary expansion.
- Restored the original Phase 1 game layout so the dynamic status messaging is back in the hero card rather than controlled by a new mode system.
- Moved the backlog item out of Phase 1 from `STORY-1.7` to `STORY-4.1`.
- Rewrote the deferred story as a narrow UX adjustment for relocating the larger changing status banner without introducing another configuration system.

## 2026-03-31 14:06 UTC

- Added a durable process note to `AGENTS.md` based on the failed status-bar interaction.
- The lesson is that when taking over another person's requirements, the agent should review the relevant UI first and confirm what the major named components are before changing code.
- A quick shared lexicon review would have prevented the mismatch where `status bar` was interpreted differently than the human intended.
- Story `1.6` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `1.6` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Closed Epic `EPIC-01` as `Done`, which completes the Phase 1 backlog.

## 2026-03-31 14:18 UTC

- Started Story `2.1` for the Phase 2 architecture-and-contract milestone.
- Re-read the Phase 2 brief and the current Phase 1 implementation to keep this milestone inside the contract boundary and avoid prematurely implementing server behavior.
- Added `shared/contracts/multiplayer.ts` and `shared/contracts/index.ts` as the shared client/server protocol baseline for multiplayer work.
- Defined the Phase 2 constants for max concurrent games and abandonment timeout in the shared contract layer.
- Defined the chosen HTTP payloads, WebSocket event types, opaque identifiers, participant roles, and canonical multiplayer game snapshot shape.
- Added `docs/multiplayer-architecture.md` to document the backend shape, endpoint decisions, WebSocket event design, and project-structure choice for future stories.
- Added `server/README.md` to reserve the backend ownership boundary without implementing the server yet.
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/project-organization.md` so the new contract baseline and repo structure are documented.
- Added `tests/unit/multiplayer-contracts.test.ts` to lock the new constants, endpoint paths, event-type set, and representative payload shapes.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Epic `EPIC-02` to `In Progress` and Story `STORY-2.1` to `In Review`.
- Story `2.1` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `2.1` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Added a durable repo rule that accepted stories should be checkpointed with a git commit before moving on, unless the user says otherwise.
- Added `phases/output/` to `.gitignore` so generated review screenshots do not pollute future commits.

## 2026-03-31 14:32 UTC

- Started Story `2.2` for the multiplayer HTTP lifecycle milestone.
- Found a contract gap while implementing the server: with no auth layer, move, resign, and abandonment-check requests need the server-issued `sessionId` to identify the acting participant.
- Updated the shared multiplayer contract and docs so mutation requests include `sessionId`, and create/join responses include the emitted event alongside the full game snapshot.
- Added the in-memory multiplayer server implementation under `server/`, including create, list, join, move, resign, and abandonment-check HTTP routes.
- Kept the transport scope inside Story `2.2` by implementing HTTP only and deferring WebSocket broadcast/catch-up behavior to Story `2.3`.
- Added `npm run dev:server`, `npm run start:server`, and `npm run test:server` so the API is runnable and testable from the terminal.
- Added server integration coverage in `tests/server/multiplayer-api.test.ts`.
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/multiplayer-architecture.md`, and `docs/project-organization.md` for the new server surface.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-2.2` to `In Review`.
- Story `2.2` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `2.2` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.

## 2026-03-31 14:44 UTC

- Started Story `2.3` for WebSocket broadcast and catch-up support.
- Tightened the multiplayer state model so move history stores the real acceptance timestamp for each move instead of reusing the most recent game update timestamp.
- Added a lightweight event bus to the multiplayer service so live game mutations can be published to transport listeners.
- Added `server/realtime/attachRealtimeServer.ts` to handle `WS /ws?gameId=...` upgrades and send an immediate `game.snapshot` resync event on subscription.
- Kept replay and catch-up simple by using the existing full game snapshot plus ordered move history rather than introducing a second replay endpoint in this milestone.
- Added WebSocket transport coverage in `tests/server/multiplayer-websocket.test.ts`.
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/multiplayer-architecture.md`, and `docs/project-organization.md` for the realtime transport path.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-2.3` to `In Review`.
- Story `2.3` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `2.3` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.

## 2026-03-31 14:58 UTC

- Started Story `2.4` for the visible multiplayer client milestone.
- Added a Vite dev proxy for `/games` and `/ws` so the browser client can talk to the local multiplayer server during development without hard-coded absolute URLs.
- Added browser-side multiplayer helpers under `src/features/multiplayer/` for HTTP requests, WebSocket subscriptions, and snapshot-to-board mapping.
- Expanded the landing page to expose both single-player and multiplayer entry points.
- Added `MultiplayerLobbyPage.tsx` for create/join waiting-game flows.
- Added `MultiplayerGamePage.tsx` for live server-backed match play and remote move updates.
- Updated `App.tsx` to coordinate single-player, multiplayer lobby, and multiplayer match state while preserving the existing Phase 1 flow.
- Added a two-client Playwright test in `tests/e2e/multiplayer.spec.ts` to prove create, join, and live board synchronization across two browser contexts.
- Corrected two Playwright test issues during implementation: one game-id parsing bug and one overly broad text locator.
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/project-organization.md` for the new multiplayer client surface.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-2.4` to `In Review`.
- Story `2.4` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `2.4` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.

## 2026-03-31 15:02 UTC

- Started Story `2.5` for multiplayer server hardening.
- Added enforcement of the `25` concurrent waiting/active game cap in `server/multiplayer/service.ts`.
- Wired the cap to return `429` on `POST /games` once the allowed concurrency threshold is reached.
- Expanded server integration tests to cover the cap, resign-before-join rejection, premature abandonment no-op behavior, invalid abandonment timestamps, and unknown-session rejection.
- Corrected the server test harness so each API test runs against a fresh in-memory service instead of leaking game state across cases.
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/multiplayer-architecture.md`, and `docs/project-organization.md` for the hardening milestone.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-2.5` to `In Review`.
- Story `2.5` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `2.5` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.

## 2026-03-31 15:06 UTC

- Started Story `2.6` for the Phase 2 close-out package.
- Added `Dockerfile.server` and `.dockerignore` as a deployable packaging baseline for the multiplayer API runtime.
- Added `infra/cloudformation/multiplayer-api.yml` as a low-cost EC2-based multiplayer API infrastructure baseline.
- Added `infra/package-multiplayer-api.sh` to create the multiplayer API artifact tarball used for deployment.
- Added `infra/deploy-multiplayer-api.sh` to upload the artifact to S3 and deploy the API CloudFormation stack.
- Added `npm run package:server` and `npm run deploy:server` so the multiplayer deployment path is callable from package scripts.
- Expanded `infra/README.md`, `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/project-organization.md` to cover the multiplayer deployment footprint and operational model.
- Verified the artifact packaging path with `npm run package:server`.
- Verified shell syntax with `bash -n infra/deploy-multiplayer-api.sh`, `bash -n infra/package-multiplayer-api.sh`, and `bash -n infra/deploy-static-site.sh`.
- Re-ran `npm run test:server` and `npm run build` to confirm the deployment additions did not regress the Phase 2 app/server behavior.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-2.6` to `In Review`.
- Story `2.6` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `2.6` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Closed Epic `EPIC-02` as `Done`, which completes Phase 2.
- Added `.artifacts/` to `.gitignore` so packaged server tarballs do not pollute future commits.

## 2026-03-31 15:18 UTC

- Started Story `3.1` for the Phase 3 spectator-data milestone.
- Added `GET /games/{id}` so a spectator client can fetch the current state snapshot for a selected game before opening a WebSocket.
- Reused the existing `GET /games?status=active` filter as the active-game discovery path for spectator flows.
- Kept the existing WebSocket subscription model unchanged because it already supports selected-game live updates without requiring a player session.
- Expanded server integration coverage to verify active-game discovery and per-game snapshot reads.
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/multiplayer-architecture.md`, and `docs/project-organization.md` for the new spectator-oriented server surface.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Epic `EPIC-03` to `In Progress` and Story `STORY-3.1` to `In Review`.
- Story `2.6` was reviewed and accepted by the user.
- Marked Story `2.6` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Closed Epic `EPIC-02` as `Done`, which completes Phase 2.
- Added `.artifacts/` to `.gitignore` so packaged server tarballs do not pollute future commits.

## 2026-03-31 15:21 UTC

- The user accepted Story `3.1` and directed work to continue.
- Marked Story `3.1` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Preparing a git checkpoint for the accepted server-side spectator-data milestone before starting Story `3.2`.

## 2026-03-31 15:29 UTC

- Created git checkpoint `9a5faee` with message `Phase 3 Story 3.1` after the user accepted Story `3.1`.
- Started Story `3.2` for the browser spectator-flow milestone.
- Added `listActiveGames` and `getMultiplayerGame` to the browser multiplayer API helper so the client can discover and hydrate spectator views.
- Added `src/pages/SpectatorLobbyPage.tsx` for active-game discovery and watch selection.
- Updated `LandingPage.tsx` so the home screen now exposes a `Spectate Live Games` entry point.
- Extended `App.tsx` with spectator-specific screen state, active-game loading, selected-game hydration, and a dedicated live-update connection path for read-only viewers.
- Reused `MultiplayerGamePage.tsx` for spectator viewing by parameterizing the page copy and improving the status messaging for `Observer` mode.
- Expanded `tests/e2e/multiplayer.spec.ts` with a third-browser spectator scenario that verifies a spectator can open an active game and see a live move arrive.
- Found that Playwright initially reused a stale long-running API server on port `8787`, which hid the new `GET /games/{id}` route during the spectator test.
- Updated `vite.config.ts` and `playwright.config.ts` so Playwright now starts an isolated API server on `8788` and points the Vite proxy at that port for reliable end-to-end runs.
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/multiplayer-architecture.md`, and `docs/project-organization.md` for the new spectator UI behavior.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-3.2` to `In Review`.

## 2026-03-31 15:30 UTC

- The user accepted Story `3.2` and directed work to continue.
- Marked Story `3.2` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Preparing a git checkpoint for the accepted spectator UI milestone before starting Story `3.3`.

## 2026-03-31 15:34 UTC

- Created git checkpoint `9910a8a` with message `Phase 3 Story 3.2` after the user accepted Story `3.2`.
- Started Story `3.3` for terminal coverage reporting.
- Added `@vitest/coverage-v8` as a dev dependency so coverage can be generated directly from the existing Vitest stack.
- Added `vitest.coverage.config.ts` to combine the unit and server suites into one coverage run with text, HTML, and JSON-summary outputs.
- Added `npm run coverage` to `package.json` and ignored the generated `coverage/` directory in `.gitignore`.
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/project-organization.md` so the new coverage command and output path are documented.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-3.3` to `In Review`.

## 2026-03-31 16:00 UTC

- The user accepted Story `3.3`.
- Marked Story `3.3` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Preparing the git checkpoint for the accepted coverage milestone before continuing Phase 3 work.

## 2026-03-31 16:08 UTC

- Began Story `3.4` for the pull request pipeline milestone after the repo push succeeded.
- Removed a duplicate `@vitest/coverage-v8` entry from `package.json` before wiring CI so the workflow starts from a clean dependency manifest.
- Added `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml` to validate install, build, unit tests, server tests, coverage generation, and multiplayer server packaging on pull requests.
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/project-organization.md` to document the new CI behavior and workflow location.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-3.4` to `In Review`.

## 2026-03-31 16:33 UTC

- The user accepted Story `3.4` after confirming there were no visual changes.
- Marked Story `3.4` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Preparing the git checkpoint for the accepted CI milestone before starting Story `3.5`.

## 2026-03-31 16:37 UTC

- Started Story `3.5` for the final Phase 3 documentation and close-out pass.
- Updated `README.md` so the repo is described as the implemented single-player, multiplayer, spectator, coverage, and CI lab it is today rather than as a Phase 1-first project.
- Added a final Phase 3 review-command section in `README.md` to make the acceptance surface explicit.
- Updated `docs/architecture.md` with the Story `3.5` close-out note.
- Corrected the duplicate `multiplayer.spec.ts` listing in `docs/project-organization.md`.
- Updated `infra/README.md` to note that server packaging is now validated by the pull request workflow.
- Corrected stale repository memory in `AGENTS.md` so future agents no longer assume the repo is mostly scaffold or that the package scripts are incomplete.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to move Story `STORY-3.5` to `In Review`.

## 2026-03-31 16:39 UTC

- The user accepted Story `3.5`.
- Marked Story `3.5` as `Done` in `WorkTracker.md`.
- Closed Epic `EPIC-03` as `Done`, which completes Phase 3.
- Preparing the final Phase 3 git checkpoint and completion summary.

## 2026-03-31 16:44 UTC

- The user asked which files were not included and then approved including output.
- Removed `phases/output/` from `.gitignore` so the captured phase screenshots can be tracked.
- Kept generated build, coverage, and packaging artifacts ignored to avoid committing noisy machine output by default.

## 2026-03-31 16:49 UTC

- Performed a markdown documentation audit across the repo for accuracy, completeness, and local link validity.
- Confirmed all markdown links resolve locally.
- Updated `README.md` to reflect that Phases 1 through 3 are complete and accepted.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to replace stale planning/review text with current tracker state.
- Corrected `docs/project-organization.md` so `server/` is described as implemented rather than planned.
- Rewrote `server/README.md` from a pre-implementation plan to a current backend overview.

## 2026-04-01 00:06 UTC

- Began deployment preparation for the AWS release requested by the user.
- Verified AWS credentials are now configured and working with `aws sts get-caller-identity`.
- Confirmed the requested static-site bucket name and the recommended artifact-bucket name are both currently available.
- Identified two deployment-critical code gaps before release: the frontend still used local-origin API calls, and the API server did not emit CORS headers for the S3-hosted frontend.
- Updated the browser multiplayer API client to support a configurable `VITE_API_ORIGIN` for production HTTP and WebSocket calls.
- Updated the HTTP server to emit permissive CORS headers and answer `OPTIONS` preflight requests.
- Added server coverage for the CORS/preflight behavior so the deployment-specific path is tested.

## 2026-04-01 00:42 UTC

- Created the deployment artifact bucket `rickw-ai-tic-tac-toe-lab-artifacts` in `us-west-2`.
- The first server deployment attempt exposed a packaging bug: `infra/package-multiplayer-api.sh` wrote both status text and the artifact path to stdout, which broke command substitution in `infra/deploy-multiplayer-api.sh`.
- Corrected the packaging script so the status message goes to stderr and the artifact path remains clean machine-readable stdout.

## 2026-04-01 12:52 UTC

- Added `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` so deployments can also be run from GitHub Actions through `workflow_dispatch`.
- The deploy workflow is parameterized with region, stack names, bucket names, and API CIDR rather than hardcoding environment-specific values.
- The workflow deploys the API first, resolves the live API URL, then deploys the static site with `VITE_API_ORIGIN` pointed at that API.
- Updated `README.md` and `infra/README.md` to document the required GitHub secrets and the manual deploy workflow behavior.

## 2026-04-01 13:52 UTC

- Updated the GitHub Actions workflow actions to their current major versions to address the Node 20 deprecation warning shown by GitHub Actions runners.
- `pull-request.yml` now uses `actions/checkout@v5` and `actions/setup-node@v5`.
- `deploy.yml` now uses `actions/checkout@v5`, `actions/setup-node@v5`, and `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v5`.

## 2026-04-01 14:05 UTC

- Prepared wrap-up handoff material for stakeholder submission.
- Corrected `README.md` so the manual deploy workflow no longer claims `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` is required.
- Added `docs/lab-wrap-up.md` with repository links, story links, command references, deployment URLs, and concise retrospective notes covering recommendations, context management, work style changes, and Codex CLI learnings.

## 2026-04-01 14:09 UTC

- Added a `Rick Comments` section to `docs/lab-wrap-up.md` noting that the effort went fairly smoothly overall and calling out the deferred lexicon issue as the main exception.

## 2026-04-01 14:12 UTC

- Expanded the `Rick Comments` section in `docs/lab-wrap-up.md` to reflect the more detailed repo record: the ambiguous `status bar` term was interpreted against the wrong component, the change broadened unnecessarily, the work was reverted, and the refinement was deferred to Phase 4 after concluding that a quick lexicon review would have prevented the issue.

- Reframed the `Rick Comments` section to present the problem as a potential lexicon issue between the human operator and the agent, and added the specific recommendation of front-loading a short shared terminology review when working from inherited requirements.
- Added the operator perspective that the level of misunderstanding may have been influenced by not authoring the original requirements directly, since this kind of simple-change communication failure is not typical in normal work.

- Tightened the `Rick Comments` wording again to capture the stronger operator perspective: this degree of misunderstanding and inability to land a simple change quickly is uncommon, and the issue may have been amplified by working from inherited requirements without enough shared technical anchors up front.

- Fixed `docs/lab-wrap-up.md` link targets for GitHub rendering by replacing local filesystem paths with repo-relative markdown links.
- Verified the wrap-up document now points at repository files and sections in a way that will work from the GitHub UI.

- Added clickable `Screen Links` sections to `phases/phase-1/phase-1.md`, `phases/phase-2/phase-2.md`, and `phases/phase-3/phase-3.md` so the referenced PNGs can be opened directly from GitHub.

- Simplified the phase documents by removing the redundant plain-text image lists and keeping only linked entries under each existing `Screens` heading.

## 2026-04-01 14:39 UTC

- Added and refined the `Note To Gabe And Tyler` section in `docs/lab-wrap-up.md` into a short signed letter that explains the screen drift, states that Rick asked for the explanation to be included in the agent's own voice, and documents the lesson that future UI work should treat the phase PNGs as a harder visual constraint.

- Rick accepted the project as done.
- Updated `WorkTracker.md` to record the final project acceptance state.
