# Phase 3 - CI pipeline and Game Viewer

## Tic Tac Toe - Spectator Sport
Update system so that:
- UI adds a Spectate button allowing the UI to see a list of active games, and view them real time.
- Server allows clients to join an existing game (get current state, receive future websocket updates), and see games that are in progress.
- A code coverage report is added to the project, and can be generated from the terminal.
- There is a build pipeline in your repo that runs on PRs (Github Actions)
    - Pipeline runs unit tests
    - Builds/packages application

## Exit Criteria
- Web server can tell client what games are in progress
- Client App is able to connect to a given game and Spectate
- A pipeline compiles/bundles, runs tests, and runs code coverage
