# Phase 2 - Multiplayer + WebSockets

## Primary Goal
Practicing thoughtful repeatable use of Generative AI throughout the full development lifecycle, not just code generation.

- Use AI to build out project READMEs and document game architecture/requirements (e.g. Project/Game requirements, system architecture, coding standards, project organization).
- Use AI to generate/enrich stories from coarse requirements
- Use AI for accelerate testing.
- Use AI to for Code Gen, IaC.
- How are you managing CLI and project context? At a certain point having a work structure like memory bank is very helpful for project health and reliable code gen. A starter AGENTS.MD exists in the repository with example suggested files.

## Tic Tac Toe - Multiplayer

- Update system to now have:
    - HTTP API Server that brokers multiplayer games
    - Server accepts/validates commands, updates game state, and broadcasts events to listeners via web sockets. 
    - A game can be spectated by either players, or by several third parties.
        - Candidate API
            - POST /games (create)
            - GET /games?status=waiting|active|over
            - POST /games/{id}/join
            - POST /games/{id}/moves
            - POST /games/{id}/resign
            - POST /games/{id}/spectate (or just websocket subscribe)
            - POST /games/{id}/abandonment-check
            - WS /ws?gameId=... 
 
    - Games that are abandoned (other client hasn't moved for 3 minutes) are marked "over" by the server and a winner is broadcasted. 
    - Either client can probe the server for an abandonment check/decision.
    - Websockets tell clients when a remote move has happened.
    - Clients suggest moves (“I would like to make move Z, in THIS game”) and the server validates the move, before broadcasting it to listeners.
    - Server allows for 25 concurrent multiplayer games (at which point issues HTTP 429s)
    - Enough data is stored to replay old games (and catch up to live games)
    - Tests cover the server’s key behavior (e.g. game creation max, abandonment).
    - A player can resign a game (game ends, other player wins)
    - System has no auth/identity for users
- Infrastructure Concerns
    - IaC is updated to capture new resources
    - Deploys into AWS with low cost
    - Update client to now have:
    - Start a Multiplayer game (creates a new game for another player to join)
    - Join a Multiplayer game (join an existing game, and start it [stopping other players from joining])
- Exit Criteria
    - A Tic Tac Toe app that has a single-player and a multiplayer feature
    - Single player games (against local computer) work as described in Phase 1 (see above). Playwright tests still pass.
    - App receives in-game multiplayer updates via websocket.
    - App allows users to both Create New and Join (Waiting) Multiplayer games.
    - Up to 25 concurrent games can run concurrently.
    - Game state and move history/order are preserved.
    - Players can create and join each other’s multiplayer games.
    - Tests that cover multiplayer behavior (create games, moves).
    - Players can win/lose together at tic tac toe.
    - Multiplayer updates are received async.
    - IaC updated to hold new infrastructure footprint.
